					<span>What is Well Days?</span>
					<p>Watch this <a class="insideLink overlay-trigger" href="#" data-overlay="video" title="Welldays Video">video</a> .</p>

				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>I don’t want to watch a video. What is Well Days?</span>
					<p>Well Days is an employee program that allows you to use one sick day a year to volunteer for a charity rather than coming in to work. </p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>Why is Droga starting this program?</span>
					<p>When we did the research, we realized most employees don’t use as many sick days that are included in the annual budget. Which means those sick days kinda go to waste. So why not use some of them a bit differently, and help the community?</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>But we’re all so busy. Won’t this throw a wrench in things?</span>
					<p>Nah. It’s not like we’re shutting down departments so everyone can volunteer together on a certain day. Well Days happens every day. Since it’s a constant trickle like this, it’ll feel the same as when a coworker is out sick.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>How many Well Days can I take a year?</span>
					<p>One. One glorious day.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>Do I need to get my boss to approve my Well Day?</span>
					<p>Nope! The system will automatically send a notice to your boss.  Once he/she approved your Well Day will go from pending to approve and you’re all set.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>Where can I find my Well Day?</span>
					<p>Just go to the <a class="insideLink" href="/welldays/calendar/" title="Well Days Calendar">calendar</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>How do I cancel a Well Day?</span>
					<p>Go to the <a class="insideLink" href="/welldays/calendar/" title="Well Days Calendar">calendar</a> and click on “My Well Days”. Click on your day, then hit  “cancel”. (It will automatically notify your supervisor, so no need to send a follow-up email.)</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>Can I attend other Well Days events on the same day?</span>
					<p>That’s a really weird question. But, no you cannot.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>What if I use my Well Day now, and need the sick day later?</span>
					<p>Don’t sweat all these details! It’s fine, just take the Well Day. We’ll figure it out.</p>
				</div>
			</li>			
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>What should I put on my Pegasus? Well Day? Sick Day?</span>
					<p>Log it as a Well Day. It’s on the list - right by “sick day”.</p>
				</div>
			</li>			
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>I didn’t use all my sick days last year and I love puppies! Can I use two Well Days this year, and spend more time with puppies? </span>
					<p>We all love puppies, but unfortunately Well Days don’t carry over.</p>
				</div>
			</li>		


			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>I just found out I have a very important client meeting on my Well Day. HELP!</span>
					<p>Go to the <a class="insideLink" href="/welldays/calendar/" title="Well Days Calendar">calendar</a> and cancel your Well Day ASAP. HR will be automatically notified, and will inform the charity that you can’t make it. (BUT, please keep in mind these charities are doing extra work in order to partner with us, so please only do this if you absolutely have to cancel!)</p>
				</div>
			</li>			
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>Do I need to do a training with the charities?</span>
					<p>Depends. We’ll send you details once you sign up - but it won’t be anything major.</p>
				</div>
			</li>			
			<li>
				<div class="faqItem row">
					<span>What is Dos Coffee?</span>
					<p>Still don’t know.</p>
